Title: Zombie Survival Quest Generator

Description: A simple script, using the provided code to create a text generator that creates a quest
using a template.

Added Layer: Forming a name by replacing two words that are adjacent each other with an array of preset names.

Statement: The effect I am trying to achieve is a quest generator that can create a generic quest based in a zombie ridden world. In essence I did achieve my desired effect but the limitations I did see is that because I did not change the given javascript code I was limited to replacing words at random. What
would be interesting to see/do would be do to link certain words so that if one was selected it would correspond with the appropriate word such as if a certain zombie type was selected then the ideal weapon
would be recommended rather than at random.
